# vim-swapnumbers

Swap the numbers on your keyboard with symbols in insert mode!

Programming languages require typing symbols far more often than numbers so we
might as well save ourselves from having to hold down that shift key all the
time.

## Installation

Use [pathogen][] or [vundle][]. Don't like that? Well, just copy and paste the
following into your vimrc. It is effectively the same thing as using this
plugin.

```vim
inoremap 1 !
inoremap ! 1
inoremap 2 @
inoremap @ 2
inoremap 3 #
inoremap # 3
inoremap 4 $
inoremap $ 4
inoremap 5 %
inoremap % 5
inoremap 6 ^
inoremap ^ 6
inoremap 7 &
inoremap & 7
inoremap 8 *
inoremap * 8
inoremap 9 (
inoremap ( 9
inoremap 0 )
inoremap ) 0
```
